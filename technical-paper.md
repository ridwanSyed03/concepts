# Investigation of NoSQL Databases for Performance and Scaling

## Introduction
The project team has been facing performance and scaling issues in the current system. After some analysis, the team lead asked me to explore whether adopting a NoSQL database could improve overall performance. NoSQL databases are known for their flexibility, high availability, and ability to scale horizontally across servers. This technical paper explores five widely used NoSQL databases, their characteristics, and why they are commonly adopted in real-world applications.

## NoSQL Databases

### 1. MongoDB (Document-Oriented Database)
* Stores data in JSON-like documents.  
* Flexible schema design for rapidly changing data.  
* Provides horizontal scaling with sharding.  
* Commonly used in e-commerce, content management, and real-time applications.  

### 2. Cassandra (Wide Column Store)
* Handles high write workloads and manage large distributed datasets.  
* Provides linear scalability and fault tolerance across multiple data centers.  
* Ideal for IoT data, messaging platforms, and logging systems.  

### 3. Redis (In-Memory Key-Value Store)
* Extremely fast reads and writes as it stores data in memory.  
* Supports caching, session storage, and real-time analytics.  
* Usually used with a main database to improve performance.  

### 4. Couchbase (Document + Key-Value Store)
* Combines document storage with key-value speed.  
* Provides mobile synchronization and built-in full-text search.  
* Suitable for mobile apps, personalized experiences, and scalable e-commerce.  

### 5. Neo4j (Graph Database)
* Optimized for storing and querying complex relationships.  
* Useful in cases where SQL joins are inefficient or costly.  
* Commonly used in socail networks, fraud detection and recommendation engines.


## Conclusion 
NoSQL databases provide multiple advantages including schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, and high availability. Each database has its own strengths: 
* **MongoDB** – flexible document storage. 
* **Cassandra** – handles large volumes of writes. 
* **Redis** – real-time caching. 
* **Couchbase** – hybrid use cases with mobile support. 
* **Neo4j** – relationship-heavy data. 

The final choice should depend on the project’s specific requirements and workload characteristics.
